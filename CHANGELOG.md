## [Unreleased] — 2026-04-27 (morning shift)

Pushed straight to web canonical (`landon-personal/gradeguardnewsync`, auto-syncs to gradeguard.org). No new desktop installer cut.

### Added (web)
- **Floating Pomodoro timer widget** — shows on every page for logged-in students, bottom-left corner. Click the pill to expand: circular progress ring, Focus / Break / Long break tabs, session-dot counter (4 dots = 1 set), play/pause/reset/skip controls, and an assignment picker so students can tag what they're working on. Timer state persists across page navigation via sessionStorage. Plays a 3-beep audio alarm via Web Audio API when a session ends. Pill glows indigo/green while running.
  **Why:** Students using GradeGuard to study had no built-in timer — they'd switch to a separate app and lose context. The Pomodoro method is one of the most evidence-backed study strategies; putting it inline with their assignments makes it instantly accessible.
- **Study activity heatmap on Achievements page** — 16-week GitHub-style contribution calendar. Each cell = one day, colored by how many assignments were completed (0 → transparent, 1–4+ → increasingly intense indigo). Hover tooltip shows exact date and count. Month labels auto-generate above the grid; day-of-week labels on the left. Shows total completions + active day count in the header.
  **Why:** The streak counter only shows the current streak; students had no way to see their broader history. The heatmap gives instant visual feedback on effort patterns over the past 4 months, and is intrinsically motivating (nobody wants blank spots on their calendar).

### Fixed (web)
- **`AssignmentForm.handleAISuggest`** — missing try/catch/finally left the "AI Suggest" button stuck spinning forever on LLM failure. Also added double-submit guard.
- **`TestForm.handleAISuggest`** — same pattern, same fix.
- **`StudyRooms.handleCreate`** — missing try/catch/finally left the Create button permanently disabled after a failed room creation. Added error state display + double-submit guard.
- **`StudyRooms.handleJoin`** — same pattern on the Join flow.
- **`RoomView.handleStartQuiz`** — missing try/catch/finally left the generating spinner stuck after an LLM failure. Added double-submit guard.
- **`RoomView.handleSubmit`** — set `submitted=true` before the API call, so a save failure left the student in a "waiting" screen with no score stored. Reordered to set `submitted` only after the create succeeds; added a `submitting` loading state so the button shows "Saving…" and can't be double-clicked; added `toast.error` on failure.
- **`Dashboard.handleCompleteFromTodo`** — awaited server writes (Assignment.update, Test.update, awardPoints) without try/catch. A failed update left the optimistic cache out of sync with the server silently. Now catches errors, shows a toast, and re-fetches from the server.
- **`MiniGames.TermGuesser.generateTerm`** — missing try/catch/finally; LLM failure left the game stuck on the loading screen.
- **`AssignmentAttachment.handleFileChange`** — missing try/catch/finally left the "Uploading…" state stuck on upload/save failure. Also added double-submit guard.
- **`AssignmentAttachment.handleRemove`** — errors were completely silent. Now shows toast.error.
- **`SmartScanModal.handleFile`** — UploadFile or InvokeLLM failure left step stuck on "scanning" with no way out. Now resets to "upload" step and shows toast.
- **`SmartScanModal.handleClarifySubmit`** — LLM failure left `loadingClarify` stuck. Now clears in finally.
- **`TodoItemCard.handleComplete`** — missing try/catch left completing=true forever on failure. Also added double-submit guard.
- **`StudyRooms.joinFromInvite`** — invite-link join had no error handling. Network failure left the student with a silent nothing on the invite URL.
- **`StudyRooms.onLeave`** — leave-room update could fail, leaving user stuck in the room view. Now navigates away in finally so the user always exits.
- **`Assignments.handleStatusChange`** — `awardPoints` call had no try/catch; a gamification backend failure would propagate up uncaught. XP is non-critical so it's now silently swallowed (assignment stays complete).
- **`Assignments.handleBulkCreate`** — sequential assignment creates with no try/catch; a mid-loop failure silently left some assignments uncreated. Now shows toast and refreshes the list in finally.
- **`StudyAssistant.handleFileAttach`** — UploadFile failure left `uploadingFile` stuck at true — attach button permanently disabled. Fixed with try/catch/finally + double-submit guard.

## [Unreleased] — 2026-04-26 (evening shift)

Pushed straight to the new web canonical (`landon-personal/gradeguardnewsync`, auto-syncs to gradeguard.org). No new desktop installer cut for these.

### Fixed (web) — recovery from repo migration
The web canonical was swapped earlier today from `base44dev/grade-guard` to `landon-personal/gradeguardnewsync`. The new repo was seeded from an older snapshot, so most of the prior shifts' "stuck on Loading…" / silent-failure fixes had to be re-applied.

- **Onboarding `saveProfile` + `handleSchoolCodeNext`** — re-ported try/catch/finally + double-submit guard + `saveError` UI under "Finish Setup". Without these, a transient error during the final onboarding step left the student stranded — same critical-path bug we fixed before.
- **StudyAssistant `generateFlashcards`, `generateQuiz`, post-quiz Socratic feedback, and the main chat `sendMessage`** — re-ported try/catch/finally with friendly fallback assistant messages. Each had been unwrapped, leaving the chat hung on a "Generating…" bubble if the LLM hiccupped.
- **StudySchedule `generateSchedule`** — re-ported the try/catch/finally + visible error-state UI with "Try again" button, plus double-submit guard. Was the highest-stakes regression because schedule generation auto-runs on data change.
- **Assignments / Tests / AdminDashboard CRUD mutations** — re-added `onError` toasts to all 9 useMutation calls (create/update/delete on each).
- **Friends `copyAssignmentMutation` + `copyTestMutation`** — re-added `onError` toasts.
- **MiniGames LightningRound + MemoryMatch** — re-wrapped LLM trivia/pair generation in try/catch/finally.
- **NotificationSettingsPanel `save`** — re-wrapped save in try/catch/finally with `toast.error` on failure.

### Fixed (web) — new for this shift
- **WeeklySummaryButton `handleSend`** — wrapped in try/catch/finally + double-submit guard; previously a network blip left the button stuck on "Generating & sending…" indefinitely.
- **SharedNoteComposer `handleFile` + `handleSave`** — same pattern; uploads and saves now surface failures via toast and clear loading state.
- **FlaggedMessagesPanel `handleBulkAction`** — bulk update loop swallowed errors silently and never cleared `bulkProcessing` if a single update threw. Now counts failures and reports them.
- **FlaggedMessagesPanel `updateMutation`** — added `onError` toast.
- **Achievements `toggleMutation`** — leaderboard opt-in/out toggle now reports failures.
- **StudentList `reassignMutation`** — admin student reassignment now reports failures.
- **AIAssignmentChat `send`** — wrapped LLM call AND the `JSON.parse` of the `ASSIGNMENTS_READY` payload. A malformed model response no longer crashes the parse and hangs the chat.

### Polish (web)
- **WeeklySummaryButton** — added a basic email shape check before submitting, so typos like "mom@gmail" get caught instantly instead of after a server round-trip.
- **Lint cleanup** — removed 30 unused imports across 18 files.

### Why
The repo migration silently regressed the web app to pre-fix state for almost every async handler in the codebase. With CMS school verification active, a single "stuck spinner" during a school admin's demo would be a poor first impression. Re-applied everything plus closed a few new gaps.

## [Unreleased] — 2026-04-26 (afternoon shift)

Pushed straight to the web app (`base44dev/grade-guard`, auto-syncs to gradeguard.org). No new desktop installer cut for these.

### Fixed (web)
- **Onboarding `saveProfile`** — wrapped multi-await flow in try/catch/finally + double-submit guard + visible error message. Was the worst bug in the app for new sign-ups: a transient error during the final "Finish Setup" step left users stuck on the saving spinner forever, unable to complete onboarding. Particularly bad for school admins evaluating GradeGuard.
- **Onboarding `handleSchoolCodeNext`** — wrapped school-code lookup in try/catch with a clear error message. Previously, a failed lookup left the Next button silently unresponsive.
- **StudyAssistant `generateQuiz`** + post-quiz Socratic feedback + `sendMessage` (the main chat) — wrapped 3 more LLM call sites in try/catch/finally. The main chat one is the most critical since it's the central feature of the AI tutor.
- **Friends `copyAssignmentMutation`** + `copyTestMutation` — added `onError` handlers. Both "copy this from my friend" actions silently swallowed errors.
- **Assignments / Tests / AdminDashboard CRUD mutations** — added `onError` handlers to all 9 useMutation calls (create/update/delete on each). Previously, e.g. a failed delete left the item visible with no feedback.
- **MiniGames** — wrapped LLM-based question/pair/term generation in all 3 games (TestTrivia, MemoryMatch, VocabGuesser). Each was vulnerable to "stuck on Loading…" if the LLM call failed.
- **NotificationSettingsPanel `save`** — wrapped save in try/catch/finally + toast.error on failure. Previously, a failed save left the modal in the saving state with no feedback (and the user might assume their settings stuck).

### Why
Continued the pattern bug sweep. Every async API/LLM call without a try/catch is a "stuck on Loading…" or silent-failure waiting to happen. With CMS school verification looming, every silent fail is a school admin's first impression.

## [1.2.0] — 2026-04-26 — Welcome / Preferences window + web bug fixes

### Added (desktop)
- **Welcome window on first launch** (`electron/preferences.html` + `preferences.cjs`) — opens automatically the first time you run GradeGuard, explaining the menu-bar timer and keyboard shortcuts. This was a real discoverability gap in 1.1.0 — users had no way to know what desktop features existed.
- **Preferences window** — accessible via tray menu *Preferences…* (or `⌘,` on Mac). Lets you toggle "Open at login" without diving into System Settings.
- **First-launch flag** — written to `userData/.first-launch-shown` so the welcome only shows once.
- **`⌘,` shortcut** to open Preferences on Mac.
- **Cmd+Shift+F shortcut hint** added to the tray menu's "Start focus session" label (was missing).

### Fixed (web — pushed to base44dev/grade-guard, auto-syncs to gradeguard.org)
8 critical "stuck on Loading…" bugs across the AI flows. Pattern: an API/LLM call without `try/catch/finally` would leave the loading spinner spinning forever if the call failed. Fixed:
- `WeeklySummaryButton.handleSend` — share weekly summary via email
- `AnonymizationToggle.handleAnonymize` — admin anonymize-all-students action
- `StudySchedule.generateSchedule` — flagship AI study schedule generator (also added an error-state UI with a "Try again" button)
- `AIAssignmentChat.send` — chat-to-add-assignments flow (also handles malformed JSON from LLM gracefully)
- `StudyAssistant.generateFlashcards` — AI flashcard generator
- `AssignmentForm.handleAISuggest` — AI subject/difficulty/time suggestions on the new-assignment form
- `TestForm.handleAISuggest` — same on the new-test form
- `SmartScanModal.handleFile` + `handleClarifySubmit` — photo-scan-an-agenda OCR flow (also added a visible error message and falls back to upload step instead of getting stuck)

Each fix pairs the wrap with a double-submit guard (`if (loading) return`) so rapid clicking can't fire duplicate API calls.

### Changed (web)
- `TodaysFocusCard` now renders an "All caught up!" empty state with a CTA button when the user has no pending items. Previously returned `null`, which made the dashboard feel empty for new users.
- `TodaysFocusCard` is now clickable — tapping it navigates to `/Assignments` or `/Tests` depending on the focus item.
- Added `toast.error()` feedback on `AssignmentForm` and `TestForm` AI-suggest failures.
- Auto-fixed 30 unused-import lint errors across 17 files.

### Why
- **Welcome window:** new users were installing the desktop app, seeing the website inside a window, and having no clue about the menu-bar timer / focus mode / hotkeys. The Preferences window also surfaces the auto-launch toggle, which was previously buried in macOS System Settings.
- **Bug fixes:** every AI flow in the app was vulnerable to silent network failures leaving the UI hung. Particularly bad for the school verification push — a school admin tries the demo, the AI hiccups once, and the app appears broken.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-04-26 — Desktop study tools

First release with real desktop-only features. The previous releases were essentially the website in a window; this is the first one where downloading the app gives you something the website can't.

### Added
- **Menu-bar Pomodoro timer** (`electron/tray.cjs`) — system tray icon with 25/5/15/50 min presets. The countdown stays visible in the menu bar even when the main window is closed.
- **Focus session mode** (`electron/focus.cjs` + `focus.html`) — fullscreen distraction-free overlay with a giant timer. Triggered by `Cmd+Shift+F` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+F` (Windows). Esc to exit.
- **Quick-add hotkey** (`electron/quickadd.cjs`) — `Cmd+Shift+G` / `Ctrl+Shift+G` from anywhere pops a small assignment-add window pointed at `gradeguard.org/Assignments`. Auto-closes on blur.
- **Native notifications** — desktop pings when timers finish.
- **Auto-launch on login** — `app.setLoginItemSettings({ openAtLogin: true })` in `electron/main.cjs`.

### Changed
- `electron/main.cjs` rewritten to wire up the tray, global shortcuts, focus IPC, app menu (Mac), and dock-tray persistence (window-all-closed no longer quits on macOS).
- Removed `dist/**/*` from `electron-builder` `files` array — we no longer bundle the React build (we load `gradeguard.org` directly), so installers shrunk by ~3 MB.
- Removed `vite build` from the `dist:*` scripts for the same reason — Electron build no longer depends on the React build.

### Why
Phase 1 of the "give people a real reason to install the desktop app" plan. The web app can't run a global hotkey, can't put a timer in the menu bar, can't fire OS notifications when closed, and can't auto-launch on login.

## [1.0.2] — 2026-04-26 — Fix Apple Silicon "damaged" error

### Fixed
- **macOS Apple Silicon Gatekeeper "damaged" warning.** Previously `mac.identity` was set to `null`, which skipped signing entirely. On arm64 Macs, *unsigned* code is rejected with the misleading "is damaged and can't be opened" message instead of the milder "unidentified developer" warning. Removed `identity: null` and added `CSC_IDENTITY_AUTO_DISCOVERY=false` to force ad-hoc signing.

### Why
Real downloaders couldn't open the app at all on M-series Macs. Ad-hoc signing produces the standard "unidentified developer" warning that users can bypass via System Settings → Privacy & Security → Open Anyway.

---

## [1.0.1] — 2026-04-26 — Fix login

### Fixed
- **Login "Network Error".** Previously Electron loaded the bundled React build from `file://`, which broke Base44's cookie-based auth (CORS + cookie scope rejected requests). Switched `electron/main.cjs` to `win.loadURL('https://gradeguard.org')` — the desktop app is now a window pointed at the live web app, like Slack/Discord/Linear desktop. Auth, cookies, and everything else just works.

### Removed
- The `isDev` / `loadFile` branch in `electron/main.cjs` — no longer needed.

### Why
The bundled-offline approach had too many auth/cookie/CORS friction points for a Base44-backed app. Loading the live URL is the standard pattern for SaaS desktop apps.

---

## [1.0.0] — 2026-04-26 — Initial desktop release

First desktop release. Mac DMG (Intel + Apple Silicon) and Windows NSIS installer.

### Added
- Electron wrapper around the GradeGuard React app.
- `electron/main.cjs` — main process, opens a 1280×800 window.
- `electron-builder` config in `package.json` — Mac dmg (x64+arm64), Windows nsis (x64+arm64).
- App icon (`build/icon.png`, upscaled from a 159×159 source to 1024×1024).
- `HashRouter` fallback for `file://` loads (later obsoleted by switching to `loadURL` in 1.0.1, but kept for safety).

### Why
Make GradeGuard installable as a real desktop app, not just a browser bookmark.
