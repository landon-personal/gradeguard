## [Unreleased] — 2026-04-28 (morning shift)

Pushed straight to the web canonical (`landon-personal/gradeguardnewsync`, auto-syncs to gradeguard.org). No new desktop installer cut for these.

### Added (web) — feature
- **Command palette (⌘K / Ctrl+K)** — new global keyboard shortcut opens a Linear-style command palette anywhere in the app. Jump to any page, Quick-add a new assignment or test, open the AI Study Assistant, toggle low-performance mode, or sign out — all without leaving the keyboard. Triggered by `⌘K`, `Ctrl+K`, `?`, or a new "Search ⌘K" pill in the desktop header. Mobile users still have the existing nav.
  **Why:** GradeGuard had isolated keyboard shortcuts (`N` to add an assignment, `Esc` to close) but no unified entry point. A command palette is the single most-recognized "this app is fast" UX pattern for students who live on a Chromebook trackpad — they can now open the planner mid-class without ever lifting their hands off the keyboard.

### Changed (web)
- **FlashcardViewer** — added keyboard navigation: `←` / `→` to step between cards, `Space` or `F` to flip. The on-card hint now lists the shortcuts. **Why:** flipping every card with the mouse is genuinely tiring during a 50-card review session.
- **AssignmentForm / TestForm** — autoFocus the Name input on open so typing starts immediately. **Why:** pressing `N` (or the new palette's "Add new assignment") opens the form, but the cursor used to land nowhere — a small annoyance that adds up across hundreds of adds.

### Fixed (web)
- **Quick add via in-app navigation** — Assignments and Tests pages used a one-shot mount effect to read `?new=1`, so navigating to `/Assignments?new=1` from a page that was already mounted (e.g. the new command palette, or the header Quick-add menu when already on Assignments) silently did nothing. Switched the deps to `location.search` so the form opens every time. **Why:** without this, the new command palette's #1 quick action was broken on the most common page to use it from.
- **AIJob poller resilience** — Dashboard's AI plan generator and StudyAssistant's tracked LLM calls poll an `AIJob` row every 800 ms to update the status pills. A single `secureEntity().filter()` failure (network blip, transient 5xx) used to throw out of the polling async function and silently kill the loop while the UI kept showing "Generating…" forever. Now wraps the read in try/catch and reschedules a slightly slower retry. **Why:** the AI plan is the dashboard's flagship feature; a wifi hiccup mid-poll shouldn't strand the user on a fake spinner.
- **TestCard crash on missing `test_date`** — `test.test_date.split()` blew up the entire Tests page if a server record came back without a date (e.g. an in-flight Smart Scan or a malformed import). Now uses `parseLocalDate` with a `hasValidDate` guard and renders a "No date set" badge. **Why:** one bad row no longer takes down the whole list.
- **StudyRooms create / join / invite-link flows** — `handleCreate`, `handleJoin`, and the `?invite=…` useEffect all called `secureEntity` / `base44.functions.invoke` with no try/catch. A single failure left buttons stuck on "Creating…" / "Joining…" with no error visible. All three now wrap in try/catch + double-submit guards and surface `joinError`. **Why:** Quiz Competition is the most-shared social entry point — a friend's broken invite link used to freeze the page silently.
- **RoomView `handleStartQuiz` + `handleSubmit`** — host's "Start quiz" button stuck on "Generating…" if InvokeLLM failed; player's score-submit silently swallowed errors and showed "Submitted!" even when the score never persisted. Both now toast on failure and restore button state. **Why:** worst-case before was a player thinking they finished a quiz and seeing nothing on the leaderboard.
- **AnonymizationToggle** — moved `setLoading(false)` into a `finally` block + added a double-submit guard, so a synchronous error during `setResult` can't strand the admin button on "Anonymizing…". **Why:** student anonymization is CMS-compliance-critical; it can't have a stuck-spinner failure mode.
- **MoodCheckIn JSON guard** — wrapped `JSON.parse` of the persisted mood selection in try/catch and clear the corrupted entry on failure. **Why:** previously a malformed localStorage value would crash the whole dashboard render on load.
- **Layout lint cleanup** — removed unused `motion` import.

### Why (overall)
First shift in a while where the main work was actually a feature, not a bug-fix sweep — the recent shifts have all been recovery from the repo migration. Command palette is a small enough surface to ship safely in one shift but visible enough that a student opening the app today will notice. The bug fixes are filler around it; together they close several "stuck on Loading…" patterns the migration recovery missed in less-touched corners (Quiz Competition, AIJob polling, the form Quick-add path).

## [Unreleased] — 2026-04-26 (evening shift)

Pushed straight to the new web canonical (`landon-personal/gradeguardnewsync`, auto-syncs to gradeguard.org). No new desktop installer cut for these.

### Fixed (web) — recovery from repo migration
The web canonical was swapped earlier today from `base44dev/grade-guard` to `landon-personal/gradeguardnewsync`. The new repo was seeded from an older snapshot, so most of the prior shifts' "stuck on Loading…" / silent-failure fixes had to be re-applied.

- **Onboarding `saveProfile` + `handleSchoolCodeNext`** — re-ported try/catch/finally + double-submit guard + `saveError` UI under "Finish Setup". Without these, a transient error during the final onboarding step left the student stranded — same critical-path bug we fixed before.
- **StudyAssistant `generateFlashcards`, `generateQuiz`, post-quiz Socratic feedback, and the main chat `sendMessage`** — re-ported try/catch/finally with friendly fallback assistant messages. Each had been unwrapped, leaving the chat hung on a "Generating…" bubble if the LLM hiccupped.
- **StudySchedule `generateSchedule`** — re-ported the try/catch/finally + visible error-state UI with "Try again" button, plus double-submit guard. Was the highest-stakes regression because schedule generation auto-runs on data change.
- **Assignments / Tests / AdminDashboard CRUD mutations** — re-added `onError` toasts to all 9 useMutation calls (create/update/delete on each).
- **Friends `copyAssignmentMutation` + `copyTestMutation`** — re-added `onError` toasts.
- **MiniGames LightningRound + MemoryMatch** — re-wrapped LLM trivia/pair generation in try/catch/finally.
- **NotificationSettingsPanel `save`** — re-wrapped save in try/catch/finally with `toast.error` on failure.

### Fixed (web) — new for this shift
- **WeeklySummaryButton `handleSend`** — wrapped in try/catch/finally + double-submit guard; previously a network blip left the button stuck on "Generating & sending…" indefinitely.
- **SharedNoteComposer `handleFile` + `handleSave`** — same pattern; uploads and saves now surface failures via toast and clear loading state.
- **FlaggedMessagesPanel `handleBulkAction`** — bulk update loop swallowed errors silently and never cleared `bulkProcessing` if a single update threw. Now counts failures and reports them.
- **FlaggedMessagesPanel `updateMutation`** — added `onError` toast.
- **Achievements `toggleMutation`** — leaderboard opt-in/out toggle now reports failures.
- **StudentList `reassignMutation`** — admin student reassignment now reports failures.
- **AIAssignmentChat `send`** — wrapped LLM call AND the `JSON.parse` of the `ASSIGNMENTS_READY` payload. A malformed model response no longer crashes the parse and hangs the chat.

### Polish (web)
- **WeeklySummaryButton** — added a basic email shape check before submitting, so typos like "mom@gmail" get caught instantly instead of after a server round-trip.
- **Lint cleanup** — removed 30 unused imports across 18 files.

### Why
The repo migration silently regressed the web app to pre-fix state for almost every async handler in the codebase. With CMS school verification active, a single "stuck spinner" during a school admin's demo would be a poor first impression. Re-applied everything plus closed a few new gaps.

## [Unreleased] — 2026-04-26 (afternoon shift)

Pushed straight to the web app (`base44dev/grade-guard`, auto-syncs to gradeguard.org). No new desktop installer cut for these.

### Fixed (web)
- **Onboarding `saveProfile`** — wrapped multi-await flow in try/catch/finally + double-submit guard + visible error message. Was the worst bug in the app for new sign-ups: a transient error during the final "Finish Setup" step left users stuck on the saving spinner forever, unable to complete onboarding. Particularly bad for school admins evaluating GradeGuard.
- **Onboarding `handleSchoolCodeNext`** — wrapped school-code lookup in try/catch with a clear error message. Previously, a failed lookup left the Next button silently unresponsive.
- **StudyAssistant `generateQuiz`** + post-quiz Socratic feedback + `sendMessage` (the main chat) — wrapped 3 more LLM call sites in try/catch/finally. The main chat one is the most critical since it's the central feature of the AI tutor.
- **Friends `copyAssignmentMutation`** + `copyTestMutation` — added `onError` handlers. Both "copy this from my friend" actions silently swallowed errors.
- **Assignments / Tests / AdminDashboard CRUD mutations** — added `onError` handlers to all 9 useMutation calls (create/update/delete on each). Previously, e.g. a failed delete left the item visible with no feedback.
- **MiniGames** — wrapped LLM-based question/pair/term generation in all 3 games (TestTrivia, MemoryMatch, VocabGuesser). Each was vulnerable to "stuck on Loading…" if the LLM call failed.
- **NotificationSettingsPanel `save`** — wrapped save in try/catch/finally + toast.error on failure. Previously, a failed save left the modal in the saving state with no feedback (and the user might assume their settings stuck).

### Why
Continued the pattern bug sweep. Every async API/LLM call without a try/catch is a "stuck on Loading…" or silent-failure waiting to happen. With CMS school verification looming, every silent fail is a school admin's first impression.

## [1.2.0] — 2026-04-26 — Welcome / Preferences window + web bug fixes

### Added (desktop)
- **Welcome window on first launch** (`electron/preferences.html` + `preferences.cjs`) — opens automatically the first time you run GradeGuard, explaining the menu-bar timer and keyboard shortcuts. This was a real discoverability gap in 1.1.0 — users had no way to know what desktop features existed.
- **Preferences window** — accessible via tray menu *Preferences…* (or `⌘,` on Mac). Lets you toggle "Open at login" without diving into System Settings.
- **First-launch flag** — written to `userData/.first-launch-shown` so the welcome only shows once.
- **`⌘,` shortcut** to open Preferences on Mac.
- **Cmd+Shift+F shortcut hint** added to the tray menu's "Start focus session" label (was missing).

### Fixed (web — pushed to base44dev/grade-guard, auto-syncs to gradeguard.org)
8 critical "stuck on Loading…" bugs across the AI flows. Pattern: an API/LLM call without `try/catch/finally` would leave the loading spinner spinning forever if the call failed. Fixed:
- `WeeklySummaryButton.handleSend` — share weekly summary via email
- `AnonymizationToggle.handleAnonymize` — admin anonymize-all-students action
- `StudySchedule.generateSchedule` — flagship AI study schedule generator (also added an error-state UI with a "Try again" button)
- `AIAssignmentChat.send` — chat-to-add-assignments flow (also handles malformed JSON from LLM gracefully)
- `StudyAssistant.generateFlashcards` — AI flashcard generator
- `AssignmentForm.handleAISuggest` — AI subject/difficulty/time suggestions on the new-assignment form
- `TestForm.handleAISuggest` — same on the new-test form
- `SmartScanModal.handleFile` + `handleClarifySubmit` — photo-scan-an-agenda OCR flow (also added a visible error message and falls back to upload step instead of getting stuck)

Each fix pairs the wrap with a double-submit guard (`if (loading) return`) so rapid clicking can't fire duplicate API calls.

### Changed (web)
- `TodaysFocusCard` now renders an "All caught up!" empty state with a CTA button when the user has no pending items. Previously returned `null`, which made the dashboard feel empty for new users.
- `TodaysFocusCard` is now clickable — tapping it navigates to `/Assignments` or `/Tests` depending on the focus item.
- Added `toast.error()` feedback on `AssignmentForm` and `TestForm` AI-suggest failures.
- Auto-fixed 30 unused-import lint errors across 17 files.

### Why
- **Welcome window:** new users were installing the desktop app, seeing the website inside a window, and having no clue about the menu-bar timer / focus mode / hotkeys. The Preferences window also surfaces the auto-launch toggle, which was previously buried in macOS System Settings.
- **Bug fixes:** every AI flow in the app was vulnerable to silent network failures leaving the UI hung. Particularly bad for the school verification push — a school admin tries the demo, the AI hiccups once, and the app appears broken.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-04-26 — Desktop study tools

First release with real desktop-only features. The previous releases were essentially the website in a window; this is the first one where downloading the app gives you something the website can't.

### Added
- **Menu-bar Pomodoro timer** (`electron/tray.cjs`) — system tray icon with 25/5/15/50 min presets. The countdown stays visible in the menu bar even when the main window is closed.
- **Focus session mode** (`electron/focus.cjs` + `focus.html`) — fullscreen distraction-free overlay with a giant timer. Triggered by `Cmd+Shift+F` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+F` (Windows). Esc to exit.
- **Quick-add hotkey** (`electron/quickadd.cjs`) — `Cmd+Shift+G` / `Ctrl+Shift+G` from anywhere pops a small assignment-add window pointed at `gradeguard.org/Assignments`. Auto-closes on blur.
- **Native notifications** — desktop pings when timers finish.
- **Auto-launch on login** — `app.setLoginItemSettings({ openAtLogin: true })` in `electron/main.cjs`.

### Changed
- `electron/main.cjs` rewritten to wire up the tray, global shortcuts, focus IPC, app menu (Mac), and dock-tray persistence (window-all-closed no longer quits on macOS).
- Removed `dist/**/*` from `electron-builder` `files` array — we no longer bundle the React build (we load `gradeguard.org` directly), so installers shrunk by ~3 MB.
- Removed `vite build` from the `dist:*` scripts for the same reason — Electron build no longer depends on the React build.

### Why
Phase 1 of the "give people a real reason to install the desktop app" plan. The web app can't run a global hotkey, can't put a timer in the menu bar, can't fire OS notifications when closed, and can't auto-launch on login.

## [1.0.2] — 2026-04-26 — Fix Apple Silicon "damaged" error

### Fixed
- **macOS Apple Silicon Gatekeeper "damaged" warning.** Previously `mac.identity` was set to `null`, which skipped signing entirely. On arm64 Macs, *unsigned* code is rejected with the misleading "is damaged and can't be opened" message instead of the milder "unidentified developer" warning. Removed `identity: null` and added `CSC_IDENTITY_AUTO_DISCOVERY=false` to force ad-hoc signing.

### Why
Real downloaders couldn't open the app at all on M-series Macs. Ad-hoc signing produces the standard "unidentified developer" warning that users can bypass via System Settings → Privacy & Security → Open Anyway.

---

## [1.0.1] — 2026-04-26 — Fix login

### Fixed
- **Login "Network Error".** Previously Electron loaded the bundled React build from `file://`, which broke Base44's cookie-based auth (CORS + cookie scope rejected requests). Switched `electron/main.cjs` to `win.loadURL('https://gradeguard.org')` — the desktop app is now a window pointed at the live web app, like Slack/Discord/Linear desktop. Auth, cookies, and everything else just works.

### Removed
- The `isDev` / `loadFile` branch in `electron/main.cjs` — no longer needed.

### Why
The bundled-offline approach had too many auth/cookie/CORS friction points for a Base44-backed app. Loading the live URL is the standard pattern for SaaS desktop apps.

---

## [1.0.0] — 2026-04-26 — Initial desktop release

First desktop release. Mac DMG (Intel + Apple Silicon) and Windows NSIS installer.

### Added
- Electron wrapper around the GradeGuard React app.
- `electron/main.cjs` — main process, opens a 1280×800 window.
- `electron-builder` config in `package.json` — Mac dmg (x64+arm64), Windows nsis (x64+arm64).
- App icon (`build/icon.png`, upscaled from a 159×159 source to 1024×1024).
- `HashRouter` fallback for `file://` loads (later obsoleted by switching to `loadURL` in 1.0.1, but kept for safety).

### Why
Make GradeGuard installable as a real desktop app, not just a browser bookmark.
